The time kick script will automatically stop players below a certain rank in a group from joining your game before and after a certain time.

```local GroupId = 0 - Your group ID.
local MinimumRank = 238 - The minimum rank that this does not affect
local KickTimeStart = 19 * 60 + 20 - What time the script should stop kicking people who join. (Must be in minutes so "hours x 60 + minutes")
local KickTimeEnd = 21 * 60 - What time the script resumes kicking people who join (Must be in minutes so "hours x 60 + minutes")```

Feel free to customise and use this to your liking however we ask that you do not sell it as a product!
